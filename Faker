//Faker is a Python package that generates fake data. It's particularly
useful when you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML
documents, fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken
from a production service.


from faker import Faker

fake = Faker()

# Generate fake user data

for _ in range(5):

    print(f"Name: {fake.name()}")

    print(f"Email: {fake.email()}")
print(f"Address: {fake.address()}")

    print(f"Phone: {fake.phone_number()}")

    print("---")
